Our project is dedicated to enhancing real-time soccer match analysis using technologies like YOLOv5 and ByteTracker. Our primary aim is to improve soccer video analysis by focusing on player identification, precise ball tracking, and the identification of significant game events.

With YOLOv5, we've been able to achieve accurate and swift player and ball detection within live match footage. This technology has proven to be a valuable asset, allowing us to spot players and the soccer ball reliably, even in fast-paced game scenarios.

In conjunction with YOLOv5, we've integrated ByteTracker, a sophisticated tracking system. ByteTracker's efficiency ensures smooth and continuous tracking of players and the ball across frames, providing a reliable way to monitor their movements throughout the game.

Our overarching goal is to offer coaches and analysts a tool that provides deep insights into team strategies and player performances. By enabling more comprehensive soccer analytics, we aspire to support smarter decision-making in coaching and to enhance overall performance analysis. Ultimately, we're aiming to contribute to the improvement of soccer analysis methods, offering teams valuable insights to refine their strategies and tactics.
